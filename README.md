# WarehousePython
Please read this before running or encounter a problem with the program!

This app is a warehouse program that uses PythonV3 by applying CRUD method. This program is made for my Python Capstone for Module 1 of Purwadhika. <br />
This program does not use OOP, instead it uses multiple def functions and the main program will recall all of these funtions. <br /> 
This program does not have a database, any item inserted will not be saved and any changes made will be reset if you re-run the program.
This program uses English as it language, but some variable might be in Indonesian.
<br />
Below are some screenshots and descriptions of my program, for complete details, please view/download the main file.

This function is to add new item for the warehouse, the program will prompt the user item name, manufacturer, item quantity and its price. <br />

This function is to modify registered item. For the purpose when there was any typo when adding the name/quantity/price or to update <br />
price when the market price goes higher or to update quantity when there is a mis-calculation when re-counting existing items.
